Recipe for making dough:

1>Combine the flour, instant yeast, warm water, sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl and stir.

2>Add in the olive oil after a couple of minutes, then continue to mix until a sticky dough ball begins to form. You can add in more water if the mixture is too dry. At this point you can remove the mixture from the bowl and start to knead by hand.
Get 4 freezer bags and spray the inside with cooking spray or oil.

3>Divide the pizza dough mixture into four pieces and put each piece into its own freezer bag. You can freeze the dough to save for another day if required.

Instructions:
1>Saute the veggies
Place a non-stick pan over high heat and add chopped veggies (capsicum). Saute for 1 to 2 minutes to just evaporate water content. Make sure that you don't over cook as they will become soggy. Take out the veggies in plate.
Later, in the same pan add onions and saute them.

2>Oregano seasoning
Put all the ingredients dried oregano, garlic powder, salt, Dried Basil,Black Pepper, Dry Chilli Flakes in a mortar pestle and crush them to a fine powder. Seasoning is ready to use. You can store it for 2 months in an airtight jar.
Now let's shape the dominos pizza dough

3>Before starting to make pizza, pre-heat oven at 240 degree Celsius with
a rack set very close to top roof.

4>Flour your working top lightly. I have used corn meal. Take 1 part of dough and shape it into flawless round ball. Press the dough into flat disc. Now using your finger give it a round shape.
Then smear olive oil on the surface of dough.
Coat a thick layer of marinara sauce.
Bake pizza dough for 1 minute.

Here comes the baker's secret - When pizza are baked at high temperatures heat cause dryness which results in chew and dry pizza crust. Commercially pizza are baked in large and highly expensive oven which comes with steam injection. That's why domino's pizza are soft and moist in texture. So what can we do to avoid that dryness while baking at home in ovens which do not have steam injection? We can generate steam by spraying water during early few minutes of baking pizza crust.
Get ready your water spray. Open the oven door, spray water on wall of oven (be careful and avoid the light bulb!) and place your pizza dough. Spray it once more and quickly close the door to trap the steam inside. Be careful don't over do the spraying because it can reduce the temperature.

5>once dough is baked for 1 minute, take the dough out of oven and arrange the sautÃ©ed toppings on crust. Sprinkle oregano seasoning.

6>Sprinkle the blend of mozzarella, parmesan and cheddar cheese. If other cheeses are not available, only mozzarella should be fine.

7>Bake pizza on 240 degree Celsius for exact 8 minutes (The baking time may vary based on different makes of ovens). Take it out and let it cool for 2 minutes and serve.
